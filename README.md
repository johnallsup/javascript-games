Some simple games written in Javascript

## Inspiration
There are a number of Javascript game tutorials on youtube. The ones by Ania Kub√≥w got me started.

## Minesweeper
This is based around the tutorial at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxdGAKRndz8

A few features of my version:
* You cannot hit a mine with your first square. This requires adjusting the mine locations *after* the first square has been clicked, but *before* it is revealed.
